# Shiny_app_Catchment_area_Malawi

This app was created to examine catchment of Viral load labs in Malawi. I created an interactive app using Leaflet and igraph packages to allow users to filter catachment area and network of patient clinics and viral load labs.

Here, I have only shared the code for the app, as the data is sensitive and can't be shared publicly.
